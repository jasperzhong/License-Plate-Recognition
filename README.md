# License-Plate-Recognition With GUI!

The program is based on MATLAB<br/>

The program use BP neural network so please note that the three NET.MAT NET1.MAT and NET2.MAT are necessary.<br/>

You can either choose to run detect.m in MATLAB where you can set breakpoints to see how the code work,<br/> or just use GUI for convenience.<br/>

As for bp.cpp, it is an implementation of BP neural network, and it works well.

Here is an example:
